# Japan "Yes" to Death Penatly?
## Description
This is my webiste(https://mymo5303.github.io/project03-deathpenalty/). What I aimed to accomplish is to focus on the situation of death penalty in Japan. As Japan uses "Hanging" for the death penalty, I tried to find out how many countries use the method and how the death penalty is executed in the world.
## Findings
I found out 38 countries out of 96 member states of the UN use "hanging" as the method.
## Data Collction and Analysis
1. For "hanging" data, I used the Wikipedia page: [capital punishment by country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_by_country). I searched the term "Hanging" in the column "Notes" by using BeautifulSoup and pandas, alligned upper and lowercase letters and scraped. 
2. For other data in my article, I went to the following websites and made charts by [flourish](https://flourish.studio/).
   * The annual number of executions in Japan: [Crimeinfo](https://www.crimeinfo.jp/data/toukei/execution/)
   * The 2022 execution data in the world: Amnesty International Global Report [Death sentences and executions 2022](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/6548/2023/en/)
   * Public opinion poll on death penalty by cabinet office in Japan: [Public opinion poll](https://survey.gov-online.go.jp/r01/r01-houseido/2-2.html)
## New Things I tired
* Scraping data from tables
* Making interactive animated charts by Flourish
* Creating a website using Scrollama
## Things I would have done
For the visualization, I wanted to make the scroll and chart animations to work in conjunction with the triggers. For the data analysis, I wanted to dig the public opinion poll deeper.
