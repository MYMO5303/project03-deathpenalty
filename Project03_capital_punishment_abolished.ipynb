Brazil has always maintained the death penalty in wartime as part of its Military Code but, after Brazil became a Republic in 1889, capital punishment for civil offenses or for military offences committed in peacetime was abolished by the first republican Constitution, adopted in 1891. The penalty for crimes committed in peacetime was then reinstated during two periods (from 1938 to 1946 and from 1969 to 1978), but on those occasions it was restricted to acts of terrorism or subversion considered \"internal warfare\".[159][160][161][162]\\nOnly one civilian was sentenced to death in the republican period, in 1969, but the sentence was commuted and was not carried out. In the republican era, all military death sentences imposed for crimes committed during wartime (the Second World War was Brazil\\'s last international military conflict) were similarly commuted and not carried out. The current Constitution of Brazil (1988) expressly forbids the use of capital punishment, except for military offences committed during a war duly declared by Congress.[163] The last person to suffer the death penalty in Brazil was executed in 1876, during the Imperial era. After 1876, Emperor Pedro II adopted in practice an abolitionist policy through his prerogative of Mercy as Head of State, by directing that all death sentences be submitted by the Courts to the Imperial Government for examination regarding commutation (even without a request for pardon or commutation from the person condemned), and by granting commutations for all death sentences that were passed.

On 5 January 2012, \"a large majority of MPs\" adopted a bill that aims to abolish the death penalty. After two years under the official moratorium, the State Great Khural formally signed the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.[259] This makes Mongolia abolitionist because under Article 1, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Covenant, \"No one within the jurisdiction of a State Party to the present Protocol shall be executed,\" and \"Each State Party shall take all necessary measures to abolish the death penalty within its jurisdiction.\" Unlike in countries that retain capital punishment officially but have abolished it in practice, this made Mongolia abolitionist in both law and practice. However some dead laws that were still symbolically binding referenced capital punishment. These non binding laws were removed from statutes by a 2015 Act, which took effect on 1 July 2016, making some people claim 2015 or 2016 as the year of abolition.[260][261] Mongolia is one of the last Eastern Bloc states (not including Eastern Europe) to abolish the death penalty.

There have been three major amnesties (1989, 1993, 1997) in which the government commuted death sentences to life sentences or less, and simultaneously reduced life sentences to 10 years. However, prisoners held for political crimes, or crimes against the state are typically excluded from such amnesties.[267]\\nPrior to the military coup of 2021 Myanmar was regarded as \"abolitionist in practice\" by both Amnesty International[269] and Death Penalty Watch.[266] This was jeopardised on 1 February 2021 when the military overthrew the democratic government in a coup. On 14 March, the military declared martial law in selected regions of two largest cities (Yangon and Mandalay) and furthermore announced the introduction of a suite of new laws and penalties for insurrection and protest, including capital punishment.[270] On 9 April 2021 state broadcaster Myawaddy TV announced that 23 protesters had been charged with murder, and pursuant to s496 of the criminal code, would face execution. The date of the execution was not announced, and it currently (as of 10 April) is unknown whether or how the sentences will be carried out. At least 17 of the convicted were tried in absentia[271] and it is unclear how many have since been apprehended.\\nWhile this would put Myanmar in the \"retentionist\" category, the legitimacy of the military government and the recently imposed martial laws are contested by the deposed government (known as the NUG) who claim sole legislative authority. The international community thus far have not decided whether the military junta or NUG is the legitimate government, and as such it is not clear whether these executions carried out by the military would be seen by the international community as lawful applications of the death penalty, or extrajudicial killings carried out by armed forces. Amnesty International now (2022) recognises Myanmar\\'s retentionist status, but notes that \"Following Myanmar military‚Äôs issuance of Martial Law Order 3/2021, the authority to try civilians was transferred to special or existing military tribunals where individuals are tried through summary proceedings without right to appeal. These courts oversee a wide range of offences including those punishable with the death penalty. Under international law and standards, executions carried out following unfair trials violate the prohibition against arbitrary deprivation of life, as well as the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment.\"[272]\\nAs of 3 June 2022, it was reported that a total of 113 people had been sentenced to death by the junta for their roles in the counter-military revolution.[273] On the same date, the junta confirmed the death warrants of four of the prisoners Hla Myo Aung, Ko Aung Thura Zaw, the long-time democratic activist Ko Jimmy, and the rapper and former NLD lawmaker Ko Phyo Zeya Thaw.[273] With the confirmation of the death warrant, responsibility to determine whether, how, and when to proceed to executions fell to the Prison Department.[273] It was announced by the junta that the executions were carried out on 23 July 2022.[274] As the military junta is not recognized by the UN, the seats at the UN seats continue to be filled by diplomats of the deposed government and because of this Myanmar for the first time voted in favour of abolition in the 2022 UN resolution on abolishing the death penalty.\\nKhit Thit Media reported via their Facebook page that the military handed down a further eleven death sentences on 30 November. Seven of the sentences are in connection with the murder of Kaba Yadana Bank manager Lt. Col. Saw Moe Win, and four in connection with the murder of Khin Maung Than, the junta backed administrator of Ward 45 in North Dagon, Yangon.[275]\\nIn addition, executions are carried out within the de facto autonomous Wa State. Wa state (officially the Wa Self-Administered Division) is nominally a semi-autonomous division located in two disconnected regions within Shan State. As such it is in principle subject to the laws, enforcement, and judicial system of Myanmar. However, in reality, the Wa State is controlled entirely by the United Wa State Army (UWSA) - an ethnic armed organisation (EAO) previously in open rebellion against the Myanmar government and military. While in recent years the UWSA has reached a d√©tente with the Myanmar central authority, the Myanmar legal system does not apply in practice within Wa State. To wit, death sentences are handed down and carried out regularly, most recently in 2020.[276] Wa State imposes the death penalty only for murder [277] and executions are carried out by gunshot to the back of the head.\\nAn other de facto autonomous region, Mong La (officially: Shan State Special region 4) on the Myanmar-Chinese border under the control of the National Democratic Alliance Army (NDAA) is also reputed to carry out executions much like Wa State,[278] however information is less reliable as executions are not officially announced.',\n",
